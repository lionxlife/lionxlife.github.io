<span>This is it.</span>

However it reads, this will officially be my first _released_ writing piece. Its been such a long time coming.

I’ve had all kinds of creative ideas dating back to around 10 years ago, way back when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon" target="_blank">the world was due to end</a> in 2012; then throughout the years while I was busy being a cog, spinning away in the machine; and then still in 2016 when I quit my job to travel; and then still in late 2017 when I first made my blog in South Korea; and then still in late 2020 while locked down in Australia when I remade my blog to now, here we are in the post-COVID world of 2022.

Some of those creative ideas did make it to reality, but it really was neither here or there. In the past 5 years I really felt a strong pull towards writing, hence making the blog. However, since its first creation I’ve gone through countless ideas, then revisions upon revisions, only to shelf or throw the idea out. Over hundreds of hours of writing to no outcome; yet in the moment, always thinking that this piece—this one—will be _the_ one to be released.

Stuck a the perpetual “it’s coming soon,” my blog sat there without a single blog post for 5 years.

But.

It was going to be my first piece! It absolutely needed to dazzle, to impress, to be unforgettable right?!

Sigh. What needless agony; who cares. It’s just the first piece of writing in some small corner of the vast digital universe by someone; why not just do the best you can right now and write away?

And so, write away I did.

What about you might ask. Well, for the longest time until now—perhaps it’s just how I am—but I noticed my brain has been taking lots of mental notes of everything: the good, the bad, the in-between, things I’ve observed over the course of my life; and now I want to work through them and dot some down that I think might be of some value to the people of this crazy, wonderful, messy and ugly world.

Somewhat like a neural network trained on billions of data points with the objective of producing insights into making sense of the human world, and perhaps how we may navigate it well, as individuals, as groups, small and big, and as a collective. I’m hoping to start some good conversations, to learn, to connect, to improve my writing, and to ultimately go to a better place my heart longs for, unknown.

In short, I want to connect and write about life and people.

Something that might spring to mind along those lines is <a href="https://www.humansofnewyork.com/" target="_blank">Humans of New York</a>. How magnificent is their work? How inspiring is it that they get to spend their life—not as a cog of a machine—but as masters of their own destiny, doing work they believe in, living off it, while helping and inspiring millions of people all over the world? Their reach now extends far beyond just the people of New York. How sublime.

It’s not just me right? Don’t many of us wish we were here? To not be managed by someone, locked in, forced, drained, until there’s barely any of you left. Instead, wouldn’t it be immeasurably more wholesome to be able to do what is meaningful to you, to be able to support yourself sufficiently and just to be able to live your life more freely?

You might ask, why didn’t you do what you love before?

Well, I don’t know—it’s complicated.

Firstly, 1-2 decades ago there were significantly less creative “internet” jobs, so even more so than today, if you were privileged you’d take your best pick at what you—a clueless teen or young “adult”—think you “love” that actually ​*pays*​. Then full of hunger to progress and prove yourself you launch into it, at first its all about this and the game-changing full-time salary takes the backseat (gotta make it past probation before you count your chickens).

But then after the countless long days into years of grinding, rinse and repeat, the shine wears and suddenly the passion is gone and it’s somehow just the money anchoring you here. Somehow, just somehow, the mixing of passion and money, over time, even the dream job somehow is morphed into an ongoing, seemingly endless nightmare.

What then? You might have a family to feed, or a house to pay off, or some other debt to service, or heck—too old to redo; you’re kind of semi-locked in aren’t you? It really isn’t that easy to just drop everything and start over for something you finally realised you love ...or think you love.

It’s complicated right?

Maybe passion, like creativity, needs to be free; not undisciplined or inconsistent, but just free to pause, to rest, to change, and to evolve with time.

Though, even if this situation is complicated and hard, what other choice is there than to bear the cost to walk where it beckons you? This welcomed but difficult guest has already made their home in your heart.

Thus—having no other options—I embark on now. For the next 1000 days with these words to mark the first step on the thousand steps journey.

21 pieces total. With this as 1, then another 20 to go. Writing, drawing, designing, making a video, an app, maybe even a website, or a game, or whatever else fitting—I want to do it all.

It’s a pretty wild thing to do in your 30s.

In my society, in these cultures and circles, the more approved thing is to advance to management in your career (or beyond), get that salary to \$150-200,000, buy those shiny big things, while looking like you are doing well and on top of it. And maybe you are, maybe this is your jam. I don’t mean to knock it if this has been thoughtfully considered and is something you’d be satisfied with, even if death unexpectedly visits.

Yep, _that_ death.

That thing our society seems to hush up really well, always seemingly delivered formally addressing distant people far away, unrelated to you, unrelated to your world, until one day when it is.

The other thing that bugs me when keeping on course by societal standards is that if I work really hard, day in day out, perhaps by the end of the year my bosses will drive into work with another nice car (only semi-joking). But really I just feel like it’s their dream I’m furthering—not mine—and if my time happens to be up, then all I could say is that regretfully I was too afraid to fight for my dream, so I sold my time to sail someone else’s dream.

You can even read about it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Top_Five_Regrets_of_the_Dying" target="_blank">The top 5 regrets of the dying</a>. Then you could see clearly the end from the beginning. How many people would have done things differently had they known how things would turn out, just waiting on another tomorrow?

The ghosts of many ideas, the spirits of many dreams that have come to me, that have been with me over the years, constantly talking to me; even while I floundered around, they kept whispering to me, ideas upon ideas, from when I was busy writing blank pieces, to times when I was pre-occupied, caught up in other things.

But it’s now or never—it’s their time.

<p class="tw-m-0"><a href="https://youtu.be/tbnzAVRZ9Xc?t=287" target="_blank">Denzel Washington</a> puts it powerfully:</p>

> Imagine you are on your death bed and standing around your death bed are the ghosts representing your unfilled potential, the ghost of the ideas you never acted on, the ghost of the talents you didn't use, and they are standing around your bed angry, disappointed, and upset. They say: "we came to you because you could have brought us to life, and now we have to go to the grave together." So I ask you today, how many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes?

So let us say to our ghosts of ideas within, our spirits of dreams hidden inside, to arise. Let us take command of our ships being tossed around in this turbulent life; let us clear out paths and make way for these creatures to rush throughout and fill the empty vessels; let embers be set ablaze to a consuming inferno, that our vessels would overflow with life.

Let all those who were merely alive awaken to their purpose fully.

Is it also your time? So what will you do?

As for me, let me hone this craft, to dedicate myself in the weeks, months and years, until I cross off day 1000 from now and look back at where I begun. Maybe I’ll fail. That’s ok, I’ve fully tried. But maybe I’ll succeed, and maybe you will too.

And where shall we be my friends?

I hope we can meet often, with any luck, again and again, until we celebrate down the road of this journey.

The journey is just beginning.

How long the road? I don’t know.\
How great the mountain? I don’t know.\
How dark the valleys? I don’t know.\
How high the cost? I don’t know.

But.

How beautiful the final view? Stunning.\
How fun the adventure? Life changing.\
How are the people? Amazing.\
How much its worth? Priceless.

So, then let us go forward,\
together,\
forever.
